# CIS320-Wolftrack
Hello, welcome to the official CIS-320 Wolftrack Github Page!

We have worked very hard over the course of the 2025 Spring semester to produce a fully Interactive HTML map of CSU Pueblo. We are a group of students from CSU and wanted to create a map that would present you with a picture and directions to wherever you click on our map! This includes every building and parking lot on CSU Pueblo's campus. 

If you would like to use this map for yourself, you can find it on the right side of the page under Deployments. It will take you to another page that contains the link to our website. You can also find it on Google by searching "Wolftrack CSU Pueblo interactive map." 
You can also find the website by simply clicking this link: https://ronang-20.github.io/CIS320-Wolftrack/

Please enjoy!
